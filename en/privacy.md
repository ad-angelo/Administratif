In this regard, we inform you that we comply with Law No. 78-17 of January 6,
1978, on Data Processing, Files, and Individual Liberties, as amended.

   orders, deliveries, invoices, loyalty programs, and customer relationship
   follow-up,
3. Building a database of registered members, users, customers, and prospects,
4. Sending newsletters, requests, and promotional messages. If you do not wish
   to receive these, we give you the option to express your refusal when your
   data is collected,
5. Preparing commercial and traffic statistics for our services,

consequences of not providing a response.

## Recipients of the Collected Data

Our company's personnel, the departments responsible for control (such as
auditors), and our subcontractors may have access to your personal data.

Public bodies, legal assistants, judicial officers, and debt collection agencies
may also be recipients of your personal data, but only to meet legal
obligations.

## Transfer of Personal Data

Your personal data will not be transferred, rented, or exchanged for the benefit
of third parties.

## Retention Period for Personal Data

1. Regarding customer and prospect management:

   Your personal data will not be retained beyond the time strictly necessary to
   manage our commercial relationship with you. However, data required to
   establish proof of a right or contract, or for legal compliance purposes, may
   be retained for the period specified by applicable law.

   For potential marketing operations targeting customers, their data may be
   kept for three years from the end of the commercial relationship.

   Personal data of non-client prospects may be retained for three years from
   the date of collection or the last contact from the prospect.

   At the end of this three-year period, we may contact you again to inquire if
   you wish to continue receiving marketing communications.

2. Regarding identity documents:

   If you exercise your right to access or correct your data, identity-related
   information may be retained for the period specified in Article 9 of the
   French Code of Criminal Procedure, which is one year. In the case of
   exercising the right of objection, this data may be archived for the statute
   of limitations period provided in Article 8 of the same code, which is three
   years.

3. Regarding credit card data:

   Financial transactions related to the payment of purchases and fees via the
   site are entrusted to a payment service provider, who ensures the proper
   execution and security of these transactions.

   For service purposes, this payment provider may need to collect and retain
   your credit card data on our behalf.

   We do not have access to this data.

   To facilitate regular purchases or payments on the site, your credit card
   data is retained for the duration of your registration on the site and at
   least until your last transaction.

   By ticking the appropriate box on the site, you give your explicit consent
   for this retention.

   CVV2 or security code data on your credit card is not stored.

   If you refuse the retention of your credit card data under these conditions,
   we will not retain this data beyond the time necessary to complete the
   transaction.

   In any case, the data may be retained as an intermediate archive for proof
   purposes in the event of a dispute over the transaction, for the period
   specified by Article L 133-24 of the French Monetary and Financial Code,
   which is 13 months following the debit date. This period may be extended to
   15 months to account for the possibility of using deferred debit cards.

4. Regarding opposition to receiving marketing messages:

   Information enabling us to respect your right to object is retained for a
   minimum of three years from the exercise of that right.

5. Regarding audience measurement statistics:

   Information stored on user devices or any other element used to identify
   users and track their browsing will not be retained for more than six months.

## Security

We take all necessary precautions, including appropriate organizational and
technical measures, to safeguard the security, integrity, and confidentiality of
your personal data, and in particular, to prevent it from being altered,
damaged, or accessed by unauthorized third parties. We also use or may use
secure payment systems that comply with industry standards and applicable
regulations.

## Cookies

Cookies are text files, often encrypted, that are stored in your browser. They
are created when a user’s browser loads a specific website: the website sends
information to the browser, which then creates a text file. Every time the user
returns to the same website, the browser retrieves and sends this file to the
website's server.

There are two types of cookies with different purposes: technical cookies and
advertising cookies.

- Technical cookies are used throughout your browsing experience to facilitate
  navigation and perform certain functions. A technical cookie may, for example,
  be used to store form responses or user preferences regarding language or
  website presentation when such options are available.

- Advertising cookies may be created not only by the website the user is
  browsing but also by other websites displaying ads, announcements, widgets, or
  other elements on the page being viewed. These cookies may be used for
  targeted advertising, i.e., advertising determined by the user’s browsing
  history.

We use technical cookies. These are stored in your browser for a period that
does not exceed six months.

We do not use advertising cookies. However, if we decide to use them in the
future, we will inform you in advance, and you will have the option to disable
them.

We use or may use Google Analytics, a statistical tool for audience analysis
that generates a cookie to measure site visits, page views, and visitor
activity. Your IP address is also collected to determine the city from which you
are connecting. The retention period for this cookie is mentioned in Article
7(v) of this policy.

We remind you that you can always block cookies by configuring your browser
settings. However, such a refusal may prevent the site from functioning
properly.

## Consent

By choosing to provide your personal data, you expressly consent to its
collection and use as outlined in this policy and as required by law.

## Access to Your Personal Data

In accordance with Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, on Data Processing, Files,
and Individual Liberties, you have the right to access, correct, or delete any
personal data concerning you, either through your online account or by
contacting us via:

[Contact Form](https://ad-angelo.github.io/#contact)

Please note that anyone may, for legitimate reasons, oppose the processing of
their data.

## Amendments

We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time, in whole or in part, at
our discretion. Any changes will take effect upon the publication of the new
policy. Your continued use of the site after the policy takes effect will
signify your acknowledgment and acceptance of the updated policy. If you do not
agree with the new policy, you should discontinue using the site.

## Effective Date

This policy became effective on 08/01/2024.
